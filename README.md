## About

tail.css provides a small subset of
[tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
that has been extracted from a hobby project. A prebuilt copy of
[dist/tail.css](dist/tail.css)
is provided in case you don't have access to the Ruby sass compiler,
along with a minimized copy
([dist/tail.min.css](dist/tail.min.css)).
There are compressed copies of those files included in
[dist/](dist/) - they weigh in at around 6KB.
